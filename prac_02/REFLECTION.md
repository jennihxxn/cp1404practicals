# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched about 10% of the lecture videos so far. It's still early in the semester, but I plan to stay consistent and catch up.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have scheduled to watch lecture videos in the evening (7â€“9 PM) in a quiet environment. On weekdays, I plan to spend about an hour per day, and on weekends, I will use extra time to review and catch up.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am actively working on practical exercises and making an effort to write code myself. Instead of just reading or watching, I try to apply what I learn in different ways, which has been helpful. I will continue this approach.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Sometimes, I delay watching lecture videos, so I need to set a study schedule and stick to it. Also, instead of just watching the lectures passively, I should actively practice coding alongside them to reinforce my understanding.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I tend to spend too much time trying to solve problems on my own, which sometimes makes me lose track of the overall progress. I need to ask questions when needed and focus on strengthening my fundamental understanding rather than getting stuck on one problem for too long.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I try not just to complete the exercises but also to think about the structure and efficiency of my code. I also experiment with different approaches to solve problems and compare them, which helps me improve my coding style. I plan to keep developing this habit.
